		<h2>About this Project</h2>
		
		<ul>
		<li><p>This project is about creating awareness for a potential designer who might want to create an online shopping website which may seem like an easy process if you are very knowledgeable about coding, but in fact involves a fair amount of background research and consideration in order to gain the certain user-website relationship every website needs to become popular.</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><p>This project is important as there are many different online shopping websites globally these days with the fact that these types of websites are still getting published especially with individual people starting their own types of online clothes selling services and without proper knowledge of how these websites work on the internet and what they must consider beofre publishing it, the website wont be attractive towrds users.</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><p>The target audeince for this project will be young adults aged from around 18 to 25 years old where this is the age students normally like to sell their clothes for extra money in which if these go to plan, are likely to grow this into a more formal based service where they buy clothes and sell them online through means of websites rather than just social media.</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><p>This project is purely intenet based and will take the position of a gateway-like of attched link to software that these young people might be using inorder to build and publish their potential online shopping websites. The link to this project wont be a barrier to entry of using the software but in fact will act purely as an awareness manual so they can get the best outcome out of their website.</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><p>I am going to approach this project by firstly reaserching how the internet works ot only generally, but how it works specifically around the netwroking world of online shopping/ecommerce based websites. I will also research how specifically online shooping website conduct their websites in order to attract people onto their website and use it more. Through this research i will summarize it and put several points and considerations as to what my poeple building online shopping website should include.</p></li>

<h3>Logo Composition</h3>

     <h1>Logo Guidelines</h1>
     <p>My logo consists of carefully taken
		measurements which should be followed
		when drawing it. The measurement shown in the picture must be followed precisely to avoid a decrease in visual hierarchy where the logo will start to look messy and unprofessional. The logo is based purely on the idea of cybersecurity and the message it tries to send is that we are here to ensure that you know how to build a trustworthy website that people will feel comfortable using. The logo of the armour and the tick is almost like the antivirus icon and represents protection of your computer and the dollar sign for the S represents the environment of the online shopping where you make money of clothes so altogther the logo signals the importance of security and creating a trustworthy shopping website. </p>

		<h1>Tone/Colour Guide</h1>
		<p>The tone of my website is represented through the color pallete of my logo which bleeds out to the colour theme of my website and my project as a whole. The darkish blue colour is a colour that symbolises security and trustworthiness which is why i chose it as the main colour of my logo and project as this is the sort of tone i want poeple to catch a hold of not only to use my website, but to develop an understanding of and implement it into their own websites and influence other users in this way. The black colour will mainly be for my font as this keeps the text readable and strong with the white acting like a complimentary color (with the black) for the main darkish blue colour. It is important to stay with this tone of dark blue as if the shade of blue gets much darker, the mood of the logo is likely to be set off and will demean the main purpose of having a 'security' tone.</p>

			<h1>Font Guide</h1>
			<p>This Hemi Head Font was picked specifically in terms of picking a font that not only would compliment and look good with my logo, but that would also convey the meaasage and mood to users about what my project is going to be all about. Through <a href="https://looka.com/logo-ideas/security-logo-design/">Research</a> i found that for 'security' based websites, the best type of font to use should be Bold Sans-serif fonts as they signal to the user the strength and safety with the fact that it shows that the website is professional and trustworthy through the 'true' information its wanting to show and this is the reason i picked the Hemi Head Font which also looks very good and compliments my logo as compared to a normal Sans-serif font like Arial or Verdana. My text Typeface font which is the Quicksand-book regular is also a sansrif font which i picked based on its complimentary to the logo (display) font. I wanted to stick with the sansserif catergory as the font used on my logo (Hemi Head) was very hard to pair up with the correct category of font (through research i found that a 'monospace' or 'serif' font goes well with sanserif) for my text in which to stay on the safe side i stuck with sanserif however chose a more narrower and less bold font so it would cancel out the heading text and make it look less distinguished. </p>
