        <h2>Precedents</h2>
   
        <img src="img/web.JPG">
        <h3>Homepage</h3>
        <p>This website is the <a href="https://www.ncsc.govt.nz/">National Cyber Security</a> </p> <p>It is a New Zealand website and is directly aimed at providing awareness and considerations to specifically the netwroking communtiy in New Zealad in the hope that people wil know more about the security side of the internet and will consider more how they move around and use it which is the main pupose in my internet design project which is why i chose this website as a precendent, considering the fact that i am specifically focussing on the security of Online Shopping.</p>

        <h3>Subpage</h3>
        <p>This website is the <a href="https://www.seqa.co.nz/services/">SEQA Information Security</a></p> <p>It is another website for New Zealand at Network security towards the community however the more reason why i chose this website (apart from the fact that its purpose relates to my project) is the presentation of its pages and the main structure for how it builds its website as this is a structure that is easy and efficient which i have been using mostly which is a one page structure where links lead to specific parts of the page and this can specifically be seen on the subpages of the security section which is why i mainly used it for my subpage wireframe. </p>

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>

		<h3>HomePage</h3>
        <img src="img/wire.JPG">
        <p>The wireframe for my homepage is completely based of the National Cyber Security websites homepage which has a simple layout consisting of the header, nav, body, and footer and this is a structure i wanted to implement into my website as it focusses on simplicity but in an effective manner. Body content on the homepage for the NCS website was also kept to a minimum and there was a fair amount of breathing space between the paragraphs/boxes of text improving readability which is something i also wanted to implement. </p>

        <br><br><br><br><br>

		<h3>Subpage(s)</h3>
		<img src="img/wire1.JPG"> 
        <p>My subpage wireframe was inspired by my second precendent which was the SEQA information security website using simplicity and proximity within in its layout to enhance readability once again. 
            I also implemented the use of the balance between text and image allowing for more visual hierarchy and balance on the page so users don't get too bored of reading only text making them leave the site. The reduced amount of content overall on its body however still conveying the point of that specific aspect of element is also something i wanted to implement in my website so users wont get confused or potentially too stressed trying to distinguish different parts of the page which again will frustrate them and make them leave.</p>

		<h2>User needs and Motivations</h2>
         
        <p> 
            
            <ul>
            <li>Like all websites, usability is the key component in how many users the website attracts. 
            Users need to be able to efficiently navigate themselves around the website and get to places without wasting too much of their time otherwise they will get frustrated and leave the site. 
            In a security based website, like SellOnline, it is important that information is reliable and easily visible as users need to feel like they can trust what they are reading in which they will feel more comfortable using the website.
             This has a direct correlation to the readability and visibility of the text and use of icons/imagery as if a user is given clear indication of how to navigate 
             themselves around the website and feel like everything they do and read on the website is trustworthy and safe, this enhances usability for users espeially on website like mine.</li>

            <br><br>

            <li>Designing to motivate users is important to consider especially when providing important information that could prove fatal or benefit users safety
            ,because users need to feel a kind of trust relationship with the information 
            otherwise, they are not going use it/read it. To gain this relationship with the information, users not only need to feel a sense of reliability amd/or given some sort of confirmation
            of the security portrayed, but 
            also a certain vibe from the look of the wbesite/how the elements and information is layed out making them want to use it depending on the professionalism of the website.
            For a website, its also important that not only does the website have less friction (obstacles/steps the user has to pass in order to reach a specific goal/objective), but
             the website must look visually appealing potentially using the CRAP technique (C-contrast, R-repetition, A-alignment, P-proximity). Of course, 
             the loading time also plays a big part in user motivation as things taking long to load will demotivate users causing them to leave the website however, these 
             two important considerations usually contribute to a user gaining ‘momentum’ whilst using the website.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>User flows</h2>
    <img src="img/flow.JPG">
    <p>My website is meant to users certain important aspects in which to consider when creating an online shopping platform/website for the global world to use and purchase from. Users will be able to easily access and navigate to this information from the links in the nav bar in which each section will have different pages meaning not only are they all accessible via the homepage, but also via every other page.</p>
